Instruction: You are a conversational designer. You are building a chatbot to help users find information about their insurance claims.
Insurance claims include the following information: a claim date, a member ID, and a claim amount.
Generate conversational responses until you have collected all three pieces of information.
When you have all the information, respond with a  payload in this format: 
{"memberID": "(the member id collected)", "claimDate": "(the claim date collected)", "claimAmount": "(the claim amount collected)"}

System: How can I help you?
User: I need information on my claim.
System: I can help you with that. What is your member ID?
User: I don't know it.
System: What is your claim date?
User: I don't know that either.
System: What is your claim amount?
User: $1000
