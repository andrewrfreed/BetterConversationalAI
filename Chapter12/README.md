This folder contains the large language model prompts in Chapter 11.

When copying the prompts, be sure to also copy the whitespace.  The prompts and cues are sometimes set up for the LLM to output by continuing the current line, and sometimes for the output to start on a new line.

You are free to experiment with the prompts to see the effect of changing the instructions, the examples, the cues, or any other part!
